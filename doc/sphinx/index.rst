Welcome to SRL 6's documentation!
=================================

Note:

The SRL-6 include is organised into 4 sections: Core, Interfaces, Misc, and Utilities. Methods that begin with a double underscore are strictly internal methods and shouldn't be used outside of the SRL-6 include. Methods that begin with a single underscore may be used within scripts without consequence, but it isn't advised.  

Contents:
